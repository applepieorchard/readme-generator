# README Generator

## Description

This command line application can be used to create a simple readme by answering various questions given on running the application. Once all questions have been answered you will be given a message confirming the README has been generated and the directory you can find it in. This application can be ran multiple times for more READMEs as needed by the user.

Throughout this project I have learned some of the basics of nodejs and how to install and integrate the required packages, or dependencies, that would allow the application to run.

### Generated README

This repository comes with an [example README](./generated/Web%20Development%20Portfolio-README.md) already generated.

## Installation

In order to install this application you can download the zip using the code button. Find or create an empty directory on your computer you wish to use and extract it. Assuming you already have node Open git bash, or another command line and switch to the application's directory then run the command `npm i` which will install the inquirer package needed for this application to run.

## Usage

To use this application ensure you are in the correct directory and run the `node index.js` command. Once you have done so simply type in answers for each of the questions you are prompted with by the application. You can see this in action in the gif below.
