  ## Installation

  N/A

  ## Usage

  There is little required to use this webpage, browse it as you see fit. If you click on the placeholders they will scroll you to them, sometimes this results in no change. If you click on the first project, you will simply reopen this website in a new tab, as it is currently the only project I can display.

  ## License
